/// This view modifier can be used to add video-based splash
/// screens to any view.
///
/// A video splash screen will play when a view is presented,
/// then automatically dismiss to reveal the underlying view
/// when the video stops playing.
///
/// You can inject a custom ``VideoSplashScreenConfiguration``
/// to customize the splash screen, and inject a custom view
/// modifier to customize the ``VideoPlayer`` view.
///
/// > Note: For now, the splash view duration only takes the
/// video duration into the consideration, not an additional
/// time it may take for the video to be downloaded. As such,
/// this view is best used with local video files.
///
/// You can add a video splash screen to a view by using the
/// ``SwiftUICore/View/videoSplashScreen(videoURL:duration:style:)``
/// view modifier, or the view modifier that lets you adjust
/// the video player before presenting it.
